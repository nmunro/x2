1.0.8.6: Another minor version bump to fix the quitting when there are unsaved files thing.
Sorry it took so long, had a few other things on.

21/10/11
1.0.8.5 Minor bugfix release.

20/10/11
Version 1.0.8.4 released and offers more improvements to the file templating again.
Templates can now be created from existing files, ctrl+shift+w to save a file as a template, note this only works if the open file has a file extension.
Some keybindings have been changed, save as has now been remapped to ctrl+shift+s (similar to other gtk apps) and preferences have been remapped to ctrl+, (similar to OSX). 
Please do be aware of these changes as I realised that printer support may be required in the future and the ctrl+p keybinding may be needed. But since I do not own a printer I will need some help with this.

Version 1.0.8.3 hopefully fixes the runtime segmentation fault on Fedora systems.

18/10/11
Version 1.0.8.2 released changing the previous behaviour of the graphical templates to be more consistent with the open function.

18/10/11
Version 1.0.8.1 released hopefully fixing two long standing bugs.

18/10/11
Version 1.0.8 released, this builds upon the templating idea and expands it to have a graphical component. CTRL+SHIFT+N to activate (assuming you have installed templates).

10/10/11
Version 1.0.7 released. This includes an expansion to our previous release where if a file that is specified as an argument does not exist then it is created for the user.

Now, if the user also specifies a file type (c, py, etc) so long as the user has a matching template file in ~/.config/X2/templates the template will be loaded reducing the amount of work the user has to do to get started.

These files are totally customisable and can be added or removed to as the user wishes.

To get started create the file ~/.config/X2/templates/template.c with the contents:

#include 

int main( int argc, char *argv )
{
	printf( "Hello world!\n" );
	return( 0 );
}

Then just run X2 from the command line with .c and the template will load the contents into your new file.

To remove this just remove the template.c file.

Fedora 32 rpm uploaded.

08/10/11
Five bugs were closed for this release, some of which were code re-factoring elements which really reduced the amount of code inside X2.

The following bugs have been closed:
#3 Create icon for X2
#8 Files can't be passed in via open with dialog
#14 Write a man page
#15 X2 doesn't see relative paths.
#16 Create files passed onto the command line if they don't already exist.

If you use Arch Linux or a source based distro you can download and run now, otherwise please do wait for the packages to be built. 32 bit rpms and debs will be on their way soon.

Oh and one more thing... This one is for you Steve. Respect and peace out.
